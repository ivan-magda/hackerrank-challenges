# Find a triplet that sum to a given value

Given an array and a value, find if there is a triplet in array whose sum is equal to the given value. If there is such a triplet present in array, then print the triplet and return true. Else return false. For example, if the given array is {12, 3, 4, 1, 6, 9} and given sum is 24, then there is a triplet (12, 3 and 9) present in array whose sum is 24.
